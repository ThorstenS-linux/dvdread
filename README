The dvdread utility allows you to create deCSSed image of protected DVD.
What you do with the resulting image is your own business, not Sony's or
Some Other Guy's one.

Example usage:
./dvdread /dev/sr0 >/mnt/sdb1/vx/Katsuhiro\ Otomo/akira_decss.iso

dvdread prints progress and error messages to stderr and dumps deCSSed
stream to stdout. If you want to debug, run it with DVDCSS_VERBOSE envvar,
e.g.:
DVDCSS_VERBOSE=2 ./dvdread /dev/sr0 >/x/y/z

dvdread depends on libdvdcss2 and libdvdread4 libraries (these are Debian
GNU/Linux names for libdvdcss-1.2.x and libdvdread-4.y.z). To build dvdread
from source, you'll need development versions of the libraries (libdvdcss-dev
and libdvdread-dev on Debian).
